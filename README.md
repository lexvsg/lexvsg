- 👋 Hi, I’m @lexvsg
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to properly google my way into a software engineering career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate both the World Wide Web and the Inter-mind web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything of any educational value to me. Coding bootcamps are too expensive and I believe in the power of you. As in, you showing me the ropes. 
- 📫 Reach me here, there, anywhere. If you even read this then you should reach out. I would love meeting mentors and maestros.
